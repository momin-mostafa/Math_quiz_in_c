This is a simple basic game. that asks the user for a sum of two integer.


What I have tried to build:
---------------------------
I tried to build a simple math quiz game in c.


What I have used:
-----------------
I used switch case.
I used rand funtion. A function in stdlib.h . 
I built a funtion based on rand function
I used time.h function.


What I have learned :
---------------------
I learnd that random function is not random.
I need to use srand to make it a bit random. That means srand is seed for rand function.
I can use clock or time which is a function of time.h header file.


Resource I have used:
---------------------
I used youtube. (baki's tutorial) for the documentry of rand function


My setup:
--------
I am currenty using Ubuntu. And GCC compiler. And vim editor.


How to run my code
------------------
Clone my repo from github.
Make sure you have gcc installed or IDE for c.
Then just compile 6dec.c
And run the compiled file.
